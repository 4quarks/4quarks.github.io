“I would rather have questions that cannot be answered than answers that cannot be questioned”} these words of Dr. Richard P. Feynman have always guided me. My passion and curiosity have pushed me to research in different areas, working in innovative projects and knowing worldwide brilliant people. Now, following my age-long ambition, I am working at CERN.
