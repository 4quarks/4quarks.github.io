### Inspiration
Reinforcement learning is one of the basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. 

> This was simply the idea of a learning system that wants something, that adapts its behavior in order to maximize a special signal from its environment.” — Richard S. Sutton


### What it does
The game starts with an empty board and starts iterating over different pieces to achieve completing the puzzle.

### How we built it
We built the environment, the agent and the engine. 

### Challenges we ran into

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
Finish the development within 24 hours.

### What we learned


### Built With
Python
